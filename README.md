# Advent of Code

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code written in Go.

The Advent of Code is a race, so the code in the repository might not be very clear or efficient. The point is to write it as quickly as possible.

# Run

Your editor or Go might complain because the main function is redeclared in each file, but it still works if you simply run a single file at a time.

Example:

`go run 2017/1.go`
